## Questions


### 1

Complete a function that takes as input a sample size `n`, a mean `mean`, and a standard deviation `sd`, and does the following:   
  - generates a random sample of size `n` from a normal distribution with mean `mean` and standard deviation `sd`  
  - calculates the sample mean  
  - calculates the difference between the sample mean and the mean of the distribution  
  - returns the calculated difference

```{r problem-1}
## Here is code to do these steps without a function
##   for n=100, mean=50, sd=10
mu <- 50
sigma <- 10
## What does the next line of code do?  Write a note for yourself that explains it.
x <- rnorm(n=100, mean=mu, sd=sigma)
mean(x) - mu

## To repeat this code many times, it will be helpful to have a function.
## We will not  use this function a lot, so pick a generic name.
## The function has default values
## Replace the XXX with arguments to rnorm()
f_1 <- function(n=1,mean=0,sd=1){
  x <- rnorm(XXX)
  return ( mean(x) - mean )
}
```



### 2

Use a `for` loop to run the previous function 1000 times with `n=100`, `mean=50` and `sd=10`. What are the mean and standard deviation of these differences? Repeat for the same mean and sd, but with `n=10000`. Compare the mean and standard deviation of the differences for this larger sample size.  The code has been started for you below.

```{r problem-2}
## Here is a for-loop
diff_100 <- numeric(1000)
for ( i in 1:1000 ){
  diff_100[i] <- f_1(100,50,5)
}

mean(diff_100)
sd(diff_100)

## ADD CODE TO REPEAT FOR n=10000
## XXX
```

### Response

How do the mean and sd of the difference between the sample mean and the input mean change when $n$ increases from 100 to 10,000?

### 3

The function `pnorm()` calculates the total area to the **left** of the given value for a normal curve with a given mean and standard deviation. Below are a couple examples. 
The difference between these probabilities represents the area between 50 and 60 under the given normal curve.

```{r problem-3a}
p1 <- pnorm(q=50, mean=50, sd=10)
p2 <- pnorm(q=60, mean=50, sd=10)
p1
p2
p2 - p1
```

Write a function with arguments `a`, `b`, `mean`, and `sd`
that finds the area between `a` and `b` under a normal density with the given mean and sd.

```{r problem-3}
interval_pnorm <- function(a,b,mean,sd){
  ## complete the code
}

## Test out your function
interval_pnorm(50,60,mean=50,sd=10)
```


### 4

Evaluate the following normal interval areas using your function from question 3.

- Between $-2$ and 2 when `mean=0` and `sd=1`.
- Between 60 and 140 when `mean=100` and `sd=20`.
- Between 90 and 110 when `mean=100` and `sd=5`.

Explain why all of these values are the same.

### 5

The function `qnorm()` finds a quantile from a normal distribution.
The first argument `p` is a number strictly between 0 and 1.
The function returns the quantile `q` where the total area to the left of `q` under the normal curve is equal to `p`.
The function `qnorm()` is the inverse of the function `pnorm()`.

#### Examples

```{r problem-5a}
qnorm(0.5) # Median of a N(0,1) is 0
qnorm(0.84, mean=50, sd=10)
qnorm(0.975, mean=50,sd=10)
```

Write a function that takes as input a number `p` between 0 and 1, a mean `mean`, and a standard deviation `sd` and returns two numbers `a` and `b` (use `c(a,b)`) so that `a` and `b` are equidistant from the mean and the area between `a` and `b` is equal to `p`.

For example, if `p=0.6`, `mean=50` and `sd=5`, then the area **not** between `a` and `b` is $1 - 0.6 = 0.4$. The area to the left of `a` is half this, or 0.2. The area to the right of `b` is also 0.2, which means the area to the left of `b` is 0.8.
Therefore,

```{r problem-5b}
a <- qnorm(0.2,50,5)
b <- qnorm(0.8,50,5)
c(a,b)
```

Write the function.

```{problem-5}
interval_qnorm <- function(p,mean=0,sd=1){
  ## XXX write this code
}

## Test out your function
interval_qnorm(.6,50, 5)
```


### 6

Evaluate the previous function to find the end points of the intervals that contain the middle 95% (`p=0.95`) for the standard normal curve and two other normal distributions (i.e., two normal distributions where you pick their means and standard deviations).

```{r problem-6}

```


### 7

The *z-score* of a number $x$ relative to a distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ is
$$
z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
$$
The number `z` is the number of standard deviations (positive or negative) that the value $x$ differs from the mean $\mu$.

Evaluate the z-scores for the end points of the intervals you found in problem 6.
Explain the similarities.
