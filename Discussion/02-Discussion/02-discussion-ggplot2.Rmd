## Grading

The assignment has 6 questions.
Your groups score will be based on Questions 1, 2, 4, and 6, so do these questions first.
If you have more time, work to complete the remaining questions.

## Exoplanet Data

We will be working with data on exoplanets; exoplanets are planets orbiting stars outside our Solar System.  The data were pulled from the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html) on September 3, 2020 (with 4,276 exoplanets confirmed as of this date, but this data set includes planet *candidates* as well).

```{r read-data}
## Read in the csv file
## There is one row per exoplanet 
## Select some variables that we will work with and rename them
## Remove very massive planet (only to improve plot visuals)
## Drop missing values; the remaining exoplanets will have estimates of both mass and radius
planets <- read_csv("../../data/exoplanets-3sept2020.csv") %>%
  select(pl_name, discoverymethod, disc_year, sy_pnum, pl_rade, pl_bmasse) %>%
  rename(name=pl_name, method=discoverymethod,year=disc_year, number=sy_pnum, radius=pl_rade, mass=pl_bmasse) %>%
  filter(mass <10000) %>%
  drop_na() 
```

The variables we will be working with are defined below.  If you want more details, please see the exoplanet archive [data column definitions](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/API_PS_columns.html) (using the column names in the raw data).

`name` = Planet Name
`method` =  Method by which the planet was first identified
`year` = Discovery Year (the year it was discovered)
`number` = Number of Planets
`radius` = Planet Radius (units: Earth Radius)
`mass` = Approximate or Minimum Planet Mass (units: Earth Mass)

## Questions

The questions use a subset of the data with only some columns
and filtering out exoplanets that have missing values in our selected columns.

### Question 1

> Make a scatter plot with `year` (discovery year) on the x-axis and `mass` (the estimate of the planet mass) on the vertical axis.  The `scale_y_log10()` is added to change the y-axis values to a `log10()` scale.

```{r question-1}
## COMPLETE CODE TO MAKE THIS PLOT
ggplot(planets, aes(x = year, y = mass)) + geom_point() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  xlab("Discovery Year") +
  ylab("Mass (Earth Mass)") +
  ggtitle("Exoplanets Mass vs. Discovery Year",
          subtitle="Using NASA Explanet Archive Data")
```

### Question 2

> Make a scatter plot like the previous problem, but use the `color` aesthetic for `method` (discovery method).

> (Your call to `aes()` will look like `aes(year, mass,color=method)`)

```{r question-2}
## COMPLETE CODE TO MAKE THIS PLOT
ggplot(planets, aes(x = year, y = mass, color=method)) + geom_point() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  xlab("Discovery Year") +
  ylab("Mass (Earth Mass)") +
  ggtitle("Exoplanets Mass vs. Discovery Year",
          subtitle="Using NASA Explanet Archive Data")
```

### Question 3

> Which method has discovered the lowest mass planets?  
> Do you notice any pattern between the low mass planets and discovery year?   
> Which method had the earliest planet discoveries?  
> (This is using our filtered data which uses exoplanets that have both an estimated mass and an estimated radius; these patterns may not hold in general.)

#### Response

XXX


### Question 4

> Make a scatter plot like the previous problem,
> but use the shape aesthetic for Position.

```{r question-4}
## COMPLETE CODE TO MAKE THIS PLOT
ggplot(planets, aes(x = year, y = mass, shape=method)) + geom_point() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  xlab("Discovery Year") +
  ylab("Mass (Earth Mass)") +
  ggtitle("Exoplanets Mass vs. Discovery Year",
          subtitle="Using NASA Explanet Archive Data")
```

### Question 5

> Does shape or color work better for distinguishing among the discovery methods?
> Briefly explain.

#### Response

I think color works the best, shape is not clear enough for a graph like this.

### Question 6

> Another way to display differences by discovery method is to  separate the plot into multiple panels (or facets) and plot different subsets of the data in each.
> We are going to look at planet mass versus planet radius here (both on log10 scales).
> Add a comment to say what the code on the next line does where indicated.

```{r question-6}
ggplot(planets, aes(x=radius,y=mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  ## adds a line of best fit for each graph in the output
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  ## Lets you read all 5 graphs at once rather than the Exoplanets Mass vs. Radius graph
  facet_wrap(~method) +
  xlab("Radius (Earth Radius)") +
  ylab("Mass (Earth Mass)") +
  ggtitle("Exoplanets Mass vs. Radius",
          subtitle="Using NASA Explanet Archive Data")
```
